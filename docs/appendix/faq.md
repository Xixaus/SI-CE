## üîå Communication and Control

### How can I monitor ChemStation communication?

**Quick Answer:** Enable verbose logging or monitor communication files directly to see all commands and responses.

**Detailed Explanation:**
The system uses file-based communication that can be monitored in real-time for debugging and optimization.

**Code Example:**
```python
# Enable detailed logging
config = CommunicationConfig(verbose=True)
api = ChemstationAPI(config)

# Monitor communication files directly (PowerShell)
# Get-Content "communication_files\command" -Wait
```

### Why does communication occasionally drop?

**Quick Answer:** Communication drops typically occur when error dialogs appear in ChemStation or when timeout conditions aren't met.

**Detailed Explanation:**
Communication drops have been observed in specific cases:

1. **Error dialog appears in ChemStation:**

    May occur when starting a method while another is still running
    Timeout not met for command execution (see `validation.get_vialtable()` which uses higher timeout for longer macro execution)
    After closing the error dialog, operation can continue
    Always use validation before commands to ensure proper timing

2. **Communication deadlock:**

    Some commands called rapidly in succession may occasionally not receive responses
    Common with `system.status()` when checking status repeatedly
    Implementation includes retry logic (3 attempts before error)
    If this occurs, simply restart the script

**Code Example:**
```python
# Robust status checking with retry logic
def get_status_with_retry(api, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return api.system.status()
        except TimeoutError:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            time.sleep(1)
```

### Can I send custom commands to ChemStation?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, use the `send()` method to execute any valid ChemStation command directly.

**Detailed Explanation:**
The API provides direct access to ChemStation's command processor for advanced operations not covered by high-level methods.

**Code Example:**
```python
# Read current oven temperature
response = api.send('response$ = VAL$(ObjHdrVal(RCCE1Status[1], "Temperature_actual"))')
print(f"Current oven temperature: {response}¬∞C")

# Get method path
method_path = api.send("response$ = _METHPATH$")
print(f"Active method: {method_path}")

# Execute custom macro
api.send('macro "C:\\custom_macro.mac"; custom_procedure 15, "parameter"')
```

## ‚öóÔ∏è Capillary Electrophoresis Operations

### Unable to load vials into the carousel

**Quick Answer:** Vial loading fails when the CE system is in an incompatible state or when pressure is applied during run.

**Detailed Explanation:**

**System State Issues:**

The carousel may be locked in certain states:
- **IDLE state**: Normal operation - carousel accessible    
- **RUN state**: Analysis in progress - carousel may be locked
- **Apply pressure in run**: If pressure is applied at any time (including additional pressure during analysis), the carousel is locked
- **Other states**: Carousel typically locked for safety

**Missing Vial Validation:**
The system cannot locate the specified vial in the carousel.

**Code Example:**
```python
# Wait for appropriate system state before vial operations
while not api.is_carousel_available():
    time.sleep(5)  # Wait for system to reach appropriate state

# Validate all required vials are present before starting
required_positions = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
missing_vials = carousel.validate_vials(required_positions)
if missing_vials:
    raise ValueError(f"Missing vials at positions: {missing_vials}")
```

---

### Can I modify method parameters programmatically?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, method parameters can be modified using ChemStation registry commands, though this feature is experimental.

**Detailed Explanation:**
Method parameters are stored in RC{module}Method[1] registers and can be modified directly. During RC.Net log analysis (see ChemStation Macros tutorial), commands for parameter modification were discovered. When these commands are executed, parameters are successfully updated. However, this approach has not been thoroughly tested.

**Code Example:**
```python
# Example: Modify separation voltage (experimental - test thoroughly)
api.send('SetObjHdrVal RCCE1Method[1], "Voltage", 10')

# Upload method, modify, download
api.send('UploadRCMethod CE1')
api.send('SetObjHdrVal RCCE1Method[1], "Temperature", 25')
api.send('DownloadRCMethod CE1')
```

## üíâ Sequential Injection Components

### Can I integrate additional components?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, additional components (stirrers, pumps, etc.) can be integrated using the common communication interface in SIA_API/Core.

**Detailed Explanation:**

- The SIA_API/Core provides a common communication interface for sending and receiving commands via COM port
- Most SI components like pumps, valves, or microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP32) communicate through this interface
- To add new components, you need to identify their control commands and test them thoroughly before deployment

**Background:**
Current control modules were developed from the source code of [CocoSoft](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-015-8834-8) 7.2, which could control additional components. Unfortunately, this software is no longer accessible.

**Code Example:**
```python
# Example: Adding a custom stirrer component
class StirrerController:
    def __init__(self, port, baudrate=9600):
        self.device = SerialDevice(port, baudrate)
    
    def set_speed(self, rpm):
        self.device.send_command(f"SPEED {rpm}")
    
    def start(self):
        self.device.send_command("START")
```

### Getting syringe volume tracking errors

**Quick Answer:** Check current syringe volume, reset tracking if needed, or perform complete reinitialization.

**Detailed Explanation:**

The API automatically tracks syringe volume but errors can occur due to:
- Mismatch between actual and tracked volume
- Incomplete operations
- Communication interruptions

**Code Example:**
```python
# Check current syringe volume counter
syringe.print_volume_in_syringe()

# Reset volume tracking - empty syringe completely
syringe.dispense()  # Empty and reset internal counter

# Get actual volume and update counter
syringe.get_actual_volume()  # Return drawn volume and overwrite counter

# Complete reinitialization
syringe.initialize()  # Full reset to home position
```

        results['syringe'] = f"‚úó Error: {e}"
    
    # Test valve
    try:
        valve.position(1)
        results['valve'] = "‚úì OK"
    except Exception as e:
        results['valve'] = f"‚úó Error: {e}"
    
    # Test ChemStation
    try:
        response = api.send("response$ = _METHPATH$")
        results['chemstation'] = f"‚úì OK: {response}"
    except Exception as e:
        results['chemstation'] = f"‚úó Error: {e}"
    
    return results
```
